INTERVIEW ASSESSMENT 

- Zoom & Coderpad 

  - Coderpad familiarity, helpful with the interview

  - Don't want to be dealing with new tech on the interview. Use it to code.
- One hour. Two problems. 
- Focus: Structured problem-solving approach , use to gauge Ruby fluency, Communication ability - practice thought process thinkthrough
- No documentation but personal notes okay . 
- Don't be afraid to spend lots of time on PEDA before jumping into  C.
  - most successful students do this. 
  - This can take a long time.
- Make sure you understand the problem.
  - Where people get into trouble.
  - Feel free to ask questions.
  - Check test cases for implicit rules. Maybe only can be gleaned this way.  
  - Do this before moving on.
  - Write down what you find out to refer back to later. 
  - Not making notes or writing things down makes it tougher to get this done well.

- Develop your algorithm from a top-down approach.
  - help with feeling overwhelmed instead of just going 100 mph, try to break it down from the top
  - What are the big steps we need to do here to solve this problem?
  - Step 1 - Iterate
  - Step 2 - something else
  - fill out the big steps with top level ideas then break it down.

- Test code frequently, verbally explain your expectations.
  - helps identify bugs in my code or logical errors
  - saves me time

- Preparation: RB101-RB109 Small Problems, Pair up with other students.
  - Medium level of difficulty in 20 minutes
  - Practice communication as well as presentation
  - How do other people approach problems?
  - That's really cool! Learning new tools for my toolbelt.
  - CodeWars - be careful not to adopt the one line string that might be 30 methods.  Find the problems, write own answer.
- Questions?

3 problems -
pair up
take this copy it into local environment. Work on PEDA portion.  Go through and break down the problem in my own words.  Look at the examples, break them down, figure out data structures. WOrk out algorithm.  Stop there, do not begin coding.  Go over everyone's approach.  Trade problems with someone who had a different problem and code that one out.

Some people have some problems that are easier for them.
